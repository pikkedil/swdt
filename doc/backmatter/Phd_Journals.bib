	The state-of-the-art drive system of today's metro or commuter trains
	with underfloor traction equipment consists of a 3-phase IGBT inverter,
	feeding two or four induction traction motors in parallel. For torque
	transmission from the traction motor to the wheelset, a gear unit
	is required for the drive. As a rather radical innovation, this paper
	presents a completely new gearless drive system for future metres
	or commuter trains called Syntegra TM based on a permanent magnet
	traction motor. The paper reports on the electrical and mechanical
	design of the traction motor, the braking concept, the integration
	into the bogie, the manufacturing and some test results of the laboratory
	test bench.

	Schmetterling genannt, erfuellt alle Kriterien bei der Nutrastmomentunterdrueckung
	wie eine normale geschraenkte Schale. Wegen fehlender Fuehrungs und
	Anlageflaechen sind bei einer geschraenkten Schale separate Schleifdurchgaenge
	und Spannvorrichtungen fuer das Auf- und Umspannen pro geschliffene
	Seite erforderlich. Die Schleifkosten steigen auf das Mehrfache gegenueber
	einer geraden Schale, welche im Durchlauf geschliffen wird. Der Schmetterling
	wurde entwickelt, um die Fertigungskosten auf das Niveau der geraden
	Schale zu senken, denn dieser kann im Durchlauf geschliffen werden.
	Die radiale Schraegung (Verwindung der Schale) erfolgt auch um den
	gleichen Winkel alpha(ind s) = 360 Grad/ v(ind c), der sich aus der
	Grundwellenlaenge des Nutrastmomentes ergibt. Die Ordnungszahl v(ind
	c) entspricht dabei dem kleinsten gemeinsamen Vielfachen aus Nutzahl
	und Polzahl. Die Schmetterlingsschale hat den Vorteil, dass sich
	die sonst vorhandenen Axialkraefte auf Grund der beidseitigen Schraegung
	aufheben und somit der Laeufer bei Wechsel der Dreh- oder Lastrichtung
	nicht mehr in der Lagerluft bewegt wird.},

	traction with main focus on gearless drive train solutions is presented.
	A 500 kW PM machine has been built before for use in the German high
	speed train ICE 3 (Koch, Th and Binder, A, 2001). The performance
	of this machine was in accordance with the calculated data and proved
	the feasibility of PM direct drive concepts for this power level.
	Costs of these direct drive motors can be reduced by reducing the
	number of coils of the armature winding. Solutions for two motors
	with low coil numbers and nevertheless rather big pole counts are
	investigated in this paper concerning electromagnetical performance
	at 250 kW power level. Two different fractional slot windings (q
	= 0.25: motor I9 q = 0.5: motor 2) are compared. Motor 1 yields lower
	total losses of 20% at rated speed and power and 33% at maximum speed,
	but needs a higher inverter current rating of 15%.},

	which results in a poor fundamental winding factor of 0,866. This
	can be compared to the ideal winding factor of one, which can easily
	be acquired using distributed windings. However, by choosing better
	combinations of the pole and slot numbers for a machine with concentrated
	windings, the winding factor can be substantially increased. Moreover,
	it is also possible to achieve low cogging torque without skewing,
	simply by selecting appropriate combinations. The presented theory

  journal = {Electric Vehicle Symposium},

  abstract = {This paper presents the design of two permanent magnet machines for
	a novel propulsion system for hybrid electric vehicles called the
	Four Quadrant Transducer (4QT). The presented machines are designed
	for a medium-sized passenger car with front wheel drive. It is therefore
	essential that the machines are compact, since the available space
	in the engine compartment is very limited. The first machine has
	a 3D-flux topology and uses Soft Magnetic Composites (SMC), i.e.
	iron powder, as the core material. The core is segmented in 48 parts,
	which individually consists of teeth and a rounded back. A rectangular
	conductor is toroidally wound around the back of each segment resulting
	in short end-windings and a high slot fill factor of 0,78. The second
	electrical machine design includes features that are unique for its
	power class, e.g. a segmented core with grain-oriented silicon iron
	teeth and rectangular copper conductors. The result is a slot fill
	factor of 0,74, a high fundamental winding factor for a tooth winding
	of 0,95, a cogging torque close to zero and high efficiency. Electromagnetic
	analyses of the proposed machines are performed with analytical calculations
	and by using the 3D- and the 2D-finite element methods, including
	torque rippel and eddy current calculations. A laboratory prototype

  abstract = {Today the calculation of electromagnetic fields in electrical machines
	and the determination of machines parameters and characteristics
	by means of finite-element methods is very well developed. The question
	is weather these solutions may serve the requirements of an industrial
	development of electrical machines, especially permanent magnet motors
	considering the wide range of applications from low speed, high torque-to
	high speed machines, field weakening with minimized cogging torques,
	losses etc. and the time limits for the design process. The process
	described in this paper serves the requirements mentioned above.
	The process is very fast and accurate enough for design purposes.
	The process is based on 2- dimensional, steady state and frequency
	domain FE-analysis (implemented in FEMAG-DC + AC) including a stepwise
	movement of the rotor.},
