Symmetrical windings design tool

In this report an algorithm was derived to present a winding in a matrix form. This compact form allows the calculation of the winding factors for all harmonics. The basis of the algorithm is the phase belt sequence and the phase belt constraint which are derived from the air gap mmf envelope functions.
